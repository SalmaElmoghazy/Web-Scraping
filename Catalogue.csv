Benefits for Organizations
If you have experience with network administration, you can use Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security to reduce resource costs and centrally manage protection for your organization's network.
Major Capabilities
Management console: The console, or Control Center, is deployed as an appliance that runs in a virtualized environment. Control Center provides full visibility into the organization's overall security posture, insight into global security threats, and control over its security services. When you activate the product, you choose one of two types of console.
Cloud: Bitdefender hosts this console, and the administrator connects to it with a web browser.
On-premises: You deploy this console as an appliance that runs in a virtualized environment in your organization's own infrastructure. You should choose this type only if you have experience with virtualized environments.
Antivirus and antispyware: Security scanners can detect and clean viruses and quarantine viruses, spyware, adware, Trojans, and rootkits on all endpoints and servers.
Behavior-based protection: Security for Endpoints stops emerging threats by analyzing the behavior of a given program or process in a virtual environment before it is executed. If it is deemed safe to run, Bitdefender continues to analyze the process while it's running to identify likely threats that have not yet been reported.
Desktop firewall (Windows workstations only): The firewall prevents unauthorized users from accessing users' computers when roaming or working remotely using unsecured networks. Configuration settings include Internet blocking and access by IP address, application, port, or protocol to protect against inbound and outbound threats.
Content control (Windows workstations only): Content control allows administrators to define traffic scan options and schedule web access while blocking or allowing certain web categories or URLs. They can also configure data protection rules and define permissions for the use of specific applications.
Device control (Windows desktop and server operating systems only): Device control applies security policies to devices attached to endpoints.

241,LVS-55543,Windows Server External Connector License (Discounted),"Description
Windows Server is Microsoft's solution for workgroup file, print, and communication servers, as well as for Internet content delivery. If an organization has a large number of authenticated external Internet users accessing Windows Server or utilizing Windows Services, an external connector license (ECL) allows an unlimited number of simultaneous connections.
This offer provides one ECL for Windows Server. For a small number of authenticated external users, a more economical solution might be to acquire client access licenses (CALs) for the maximum number of simultaneous connections expected. Please note that an organization with an ECL still has to acquire CALs for the internal devices accessing the server. No license is required for anonymous Internet users.

Windows Server Standard is a server operating system that enables a computer to handle network roles such as print server, domain controller, web server, and file server. As a server operating system, it is also the platform for separately acquired server applications such as Exchange Server or SQL Server. The Standard edition is designed for small-to-medium-sized organizations with physical or lightly virtualized server environments.
This offer provides two core licenses for Windows Server Standard. Windows Server requires a minimum of 8 core licenses for each physical processor and a minimum of 16 core licenses for each server. The Standard edition allows up to two virtual instances of the server software when all cores on the server are licensed. For additional licensing information, see Understanding the Microsoft Server Solutions Available to Your Nonprofit.
Which Versions of This Software Are Available?
You can choose to download the current version or the previous version of this software. You can find out which version is the current one on the Current Versions of Microsoft Products page. In addition, you can download the software in any language that's available.
Benefits for Organizations
If you have system administration experience, you can use Windows Server to
Run multiple server roles and different operating systems on a single server
Reduce the amount of hardware needed to run server workloads
Minimize the time it takes to set up hardware and software and reproduce test environments
Major Capabilities
Server virtualization: Windows Server provides tools for creating and managing a virtualized server computing environment. You can replicate a virtual machine from one location to another, without shared storage, storage arrays, or other replication technologies.
Server management: Server Core and Nano Server provide minimal environments for running specific server roles. Those roles are then easier to maintain and manage and less exposed to attack. Administrators can manage groups of servers collectively from within a single, integrated console.
Integrated services: Windows Server delivers a unified platform for web publishing that integrates IIS, ASP.NET, and Windows Communication Foundation and also supports SharePoint Services.
Failover clustering: Administrators can minimize disruptions of services and applications by creating a redundant server environment with dynamic hardware partitioning.
DirectAccess: This secure tunneling feature allows access to the network from any computer or device. It is faster than typical VPN connections and provides off-site access to file shares, on-premises equipment, and other resources.

Licensing Requirements
This product includes a cloud license that provides product updates and support for a specified duration. Meraki devices are cloud-managed, so a cloud license is required for each device.
You'll need to obtain new licenses before your old licenses expire to continue using this Meraki product. Discounted licenses for this product might be available through Cisco Meraki for Nonprofits at TechSoup Canada. If you choose not to renew, you will no longer be able to manage this product via the Meraki cloud, and this product will cease to function.
Meraki cloud licenses use a ""co-termination"" licensing model by default, but you can opt in to per-device licensing through the Meraki Dashboard after you set up your account.
Co-termination licensing means that when you request new licenses for your devices, the terms of your new and existing licenses will be averaged together so that all of your licenses will expire on the same date.
Per-device licensing means that each of your products is licensed individually, and the licenses assigned to those products might expire on different dates.
